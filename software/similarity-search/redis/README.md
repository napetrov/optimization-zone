# Redis Vector Search Optimization Guide

This guide describes best practices for optimizing vector similarity search performance in Redis on Intel Xeon processors. Redis 8.2+ includes SVS-VAMANA, a graph-based vector index with Intel's compression technologies (LVQ and LeanVec) from Intel's Scalable Vector Search (SVS) library.

## Overview

Redis Query Engine supports three vector index types: FLAT, HNSW, and SVS-VAMANA. SVS-VAMANA combines the [Vamana graph-based search algorithm](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/09853c7fb1d3f8ee67a61b6bf4a7f8e6-Paper.pdf) (Subramanya et al., NeurIPS 2019) with Intel's compression technologies (LVQ and LeanVec), delivering optimal performance on servers with AVX-512 support.

**Key Benefits of SVS-VAMANA:**

- **Memory Efficiency**: 26–37% total memory savings compared to HNSW, with 51–74% reduction in index memory
- **Higher Throughput**: Up to 144% higher QPS compared to HNSW on high-dimensional datasets
- **Lower Latency**: Up to 60% reduction in p50/p95 latencies under load
- **Maintained Accuracy**: Matches HNSW precision levels while delivering performance improvements

## SVS-VAMANA Configuration

### Creating an SVS-VAMANA Index

```
FT.CREATE my_index
  ON HASH
  PREFIX 1 doc:
  SCHEMA embedding VECTOR SVS-VAMANA 12
    TYPE FLOAT32
    DIM 768
    DISTANCE_METRIC COSINE
    GRAPH_MAX_DEGREE 64
    CONSTRUCTION_WINDOW_SIZE 200
    COMPRESSION LVQ4x8
```

### Index Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default | Tuning Guidance |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| TYPE | Vector data type (FLOAT16, FLOAT32) | - | FLOAT32 for accuracy, FLOAT16 for memory |
| DIM | Vector dimensions | - | Must match your embeddings |
| DISTANCE_METRIC | L2, IP, or COSINE | - | L2 for normalized embeddings |
| GRAPH_MAX_DEGREE | Max edges per node | 32 | Equivalent to HNSW's M × 2; higher = better recall, more memory |
| CONSTRUCTION_WINDOW_SIZE | Build search window | 200 | Higher = better graph quality, slower build |
| SEARCH_WINDOW_SIZE | Query search window | 10 | Higher = better recall, slower |
| REDUCE | Target dimension for LeanVec | DIM/2 | Lower = faster search, may reduce recall |
| COMPRESSION | LVQ/LeanVec type | none | See compression section |
| TRAINING_THRESHOLD | Vectors for learning compression | 10240 | Increase if recall is low |

## Vector Compression

Intel SVS provides advanced compression techniques that reduce memory usage while maintaining search quality.

### Compression Options

| Compression | Bits/Dim | Memory Reduction | Best For |
|-------------|----------|------------------|----------|
| None | 32 (FLOAT32) | 1x (baseline) | Maximum accuracy |
| LVQ8 | 8 | ~4x | Fast ingestion, good balance |
| LVQ4x4 | 4+4 | ~4x | Fast search, dimensions < 768 |
| LVQ4x8 | 4+8 | ~2.5x | High recall with compression |
| LeanVec4x8 |4/f+8 | ~3x | High-dimensional vectors (768+) |
| LeanVec8x8 | 8/f+8 | ~2.5x | Best recall with LeanVec |

The LeanVec dimensionality reduction factor `f` is the full dimensionality divided by the reduced dimensionality.

### Choosing Compression by Use Case

| Embedding Category | Example Embeddings | Compression Strategy |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Text Embeddings | Cohere embed-v3 (1024), OpenAI ada-002 (1536) | LeanVec4x8 |
| Image Embeddings | ResNet-152 (2048), ViT (768+) | LeanVec4x8 |
| Multimodal | CLIP ViT-B/32 (512) | LVQ8 |
| Lower Dimensional | Custom embeddings (<768) | LVQ4x4 or LVQ4x8 |

### Example with LeanVec Compression

```
FT.CREATE my_index
  ON HASH
  PREFIX 1 doc:
  SCHEMA embedding VECTOR SVS-VAMANA 12
    TYPE FLOAT32
    DIM 1536
    DISTANCE_METRIC COSINE
    COMPRESSION LeanVec4x8
    REDUCE 384
    TRAINING_THRESHOLD 20000
```

## Performance Tuning

### Runtime Query Parameters

Adjust search parameters at query time for precision/performance trade-offs:

```
FT.SEARCH my_index
  "*=>[KNN 10 @embedding $BLOB SEARCH_WINDOW_SIZE $SW]"
  PARAMS 4 BLOB "\x12\xa9..." SW 50
  DIALECT 2
```

| Parameter | Effect | Trade-off |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| SEARCH_WINDOW_SIZE | Larger = higher recall | Higher latency |

### Redis Configuration

## Benchmarks

Based on [Redis benchmarking](https://redis.io/blog/tech-dive-comprehensive-compression-leveraging-quantization-and-dimensionality-reduction/), SVS-VAMANA delivers significant improvements over HNSW:

### Memory Savings

SVS-VAMANA with LVQ8 compression achieves consistent memory reductions across datasets (LVQ8 used as a common baseline; for Cohere and DBpedia embeddings, LeanVec is recommended in production — see [Compression section](#vector-compression)):

| Dataset | Dimensions | Total Memory Reduction | Index Memory Reduction |
|---------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| LAION | 512 | 26% | 51% |
| Cohere | 768 | 35% | 70% |
| DBpedia | 1536 | 37% | 74% |

### Throughput Improvements (FP32)

At 0.95 precision, compared to HNSW:

| Dataset | Dimensions | QPS Improvement |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Cohere | 768 | Up to 144% higher |
| DBpedia | 1536 | Up to 60% higher |
| LAION | 512 | 0-15% (marginal) |

SVS-VAMANA is most effective at improving throughput for medium-to-high dimensional embeddings (768+ dimensions).

### Latency Improvements (FP32, High Concurrency)

| Dataset | p50 Latency Reduction | p95 Latency Reduction |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Cohere (768d) | 60% | 57% |
| DBpedia (1536d) | 46% | 36% |

### Precision vs. Performance

At every precision point from ~0.92 to 0.99, SVS-VAMANA matches HNSW accuracy while delivering higher throughput. At high precision (0.99), SVS-VAMANA sustains up to 1.5x better throughput.

### Ingestion Trade-offs

SVS-VAMANA index construction is slower than HNSW due to graph construction complexity and compression processing. On x86 platforms:
- LeanVec: Can be up to 25% faster or 33% slower than HNSW depending on dataset
- LVQ: Up to 2.6x slower than HNSW

This trade-off is acceptable for workloads where query performance and memory efficiency are priorities.

## FAQ

### Q: When should I use SVS-VAMANA vs HNSW?

**A:** Use SVS-VAMANA when:
- Running on Intel Xeon processors with AVX-512
- Memory efficiency is important (26-37% savings)
- You have medium-to-high dimensional vectors (768+)
- Query throughput and latency are priorities

Use HNSW when:
- Running on ARM platforms (HNSW offers both faster search and faster ingestion on ARM)
- Working with lower-dimensional vectors (<512) and needing faster index construction

### Q: Are LVQ and LeanVec available in Redis Open Source?

**A:** The basic SVS-VAMANA algorithm with 8-bit scalar quantization (SQ8) is available in Redis Open Source on all platforms. Intel's LVQ and LeanVec optimizations require:
- Intel hardware with AVX-512
- Redis Software (commercial) or [building Redis Open Source](https://github.com/redis/redis?tab=readme-ov-file#running-redis-with-the-query-engine-and-optional-proprietary-intel-svs-vamana-optimisations) with `BUILD_INTEL_SVS_OPT=yes`

On non-Intel platforms (AMD, ARM), SVS-VAMANA automatically falls back to SQ8 compression—no code changes required.

### Q: What if recall is too low with compression?

**A:** Try these steps in order:
1. Increase `SEARCH_WINDOW_SIZE` at query time
2. For LeanVec, try a larger `REDUCE` value (closer to original dimensions)
3. Increase `TRAINING_THRESHOLD` (e.g., 50000) if using LeanVec
4. Switch to higher-bit compression (LVQ4x8 → LVQ8, or LeanVec4x8 → LeanVec8x8)
5. Increase `GRAPH_MAX_DEGREE` (e.g., 64 or 128)

### Q: Does SVS-VAMANA work on non-Intel hardware?

**A:** Yes! The API is unified and SVS-VAMANA runs on any x86 or ARM platform—no code changes needed. The library automatically selects the best available implementation:

- **Intel (AVX-512)**: Full LVQ/LeanVec optimizations for maximum performance
- **AMD/Other x86**: SQ8 fallback implementation, which benchmarks show is also quite fast—often comparable performance
- **ARM**: SQ8 fallback works; however, HNSW may be preferable due to slower SVS ingestion on ARM

Your application code stays the same regardless of hardware. Ideal performance is achieved on Intel Xeon with AVX-512, but you can deploy and test on any platform without modification.
